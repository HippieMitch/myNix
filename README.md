This is my personal Nix OS setup.  I am trying to have the individual parts of my system referenced in "system-imports.nix" (for system packages) and "home-imports.nix" (for home packages).  The idea is to allow for easily adding and removing individual things like, kernels, daemons, modules, and desktop environments through Nix abstractions.  All system and home user applications are defined in "system-packages.nix" and "home-packages.nix" respectively.
